## Guidelines

* Functions returning a value that may be tracked should not `addValueRef` : the result value might not be captured.

## Exceptions

Exception handling must be done in custom `try`/`catch` blocks and triggers manual unstacking.

- üóπ Rename Error to Exception
- ‚òê An exception should be maintained in the engine state to keep track of memory. This last exception should be cleared before reusing the engine (`reset`?)
