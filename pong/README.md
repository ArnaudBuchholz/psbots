# ðŸ¤– psbots / pong

## Overview

The classical [pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) game but with a twist : each pad is controlled with a psbot.

It will be possible to build and test a pad controller, fight against existing pad controllers.

## Constraints

Several constraints are defined :

* Dimensions and coordinates are expressed in pixels
  * (0,0) is the top left corner
  * The ball start at the center of the arena, in a random direction (limits are defined to ensure it goes either left or right)
* The time unit of measure is based on ?
  * Speeds (ball, pad) are expressed in pixels / unit of measure
* Each time the ball hits a pad, its speed increases (?)
* Each engine will have limitations, they are not necessarily equivalent
  * Number of cycles per unit of time
  * Memory
* Pad controllers I/O :
  * Input :
    * board information (`board_width`, `board_height`, `paddle_width`, `paddle_height`)
    * current pad position (`current_y`, `current_x`)
    * opponent pad position (`opponent_y`, `opponent_x`)
    * ball information (`ball_center_x`, `ball_center_y`, `ball_radius`, `ball_speed_x`, `ball_speed_y`)
  * Output :
    * direction (`up` or `down`)
* The match can either be watched in real time or simulated for faster resolution
   
## Example psbot

```postscript
{
  % Adjust pad position based on current position of the ball
  ball_center_y current_y paddle_height 2 div pop add lt "up" "down" ifelse
  set_direction
} loop
```

## Ideas

* Limit the number of allowed cycles (the program stops after)
* Limit the energy to move, allow the paddle to stop
* Energize the paddle to increase the ball speed (consumes energy)
* Spin effect to make the ball have a non linear trajectory
* Obstacles
* Power Ups / Downs (energy, blockers, bigger paddle, smaller...)
